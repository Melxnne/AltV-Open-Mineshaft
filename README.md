## Features

- **Open Access**: Allows players to enter the mineshaft by removing the obstructive door.
- **Simple Installation**: Easily add this resource to your server with minimal setup.
- **Focused Modification**: No additional scripts or effects; this resource only alters the door access.

2. **Place the folder** into your serverâ€™s `resources` directory.
3. **Add the resource to your server config** by including it in the `server.toml`:
